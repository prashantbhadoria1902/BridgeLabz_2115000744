Today's Summary;
1. 2D Arrays & Loops: Matrices are handled with 2D arrays and nested loops for element access.
2. Methods: Code is organized into methods for each matrix operation (add, subtract, multiply, transpose, inverse, determinant).
3. Random Numbers & Formatting: Random numbers generate test matrices, and printf formats output for readability.

Today's Summary;
1. String and Number Operations – Includes functions for string manipulations (palindrome check, anagrams, substring occurrences) and numerical computations (factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, LCM).
2. Date and Time Handling – Uses ZonedDateTime and LocalDate for time zones, date arithmetic, formatting, and comparison.
3. Modular and Recursive Programming – Implements modular functions for tasks like prime checking, number guessing, conversions, and mathematical calculations, including recursion for factorial computation.
