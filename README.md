Today's Summary;
Programs for Basic Operations:
1. We created programs to calculate the power of a number, identify Armstrong numbers, and determine if a given date is in the spring season. These involve loops, conditions, and mathematical logic.
Practical Applications:
2. Implemented a bonus calculation program, a day-of-week calculator using command-line arguments, and a simple calculator using switch-case to handle arithmetic operations.
Logical Flow and Validations:
3. All programs include user input handling and necessary validations, such as checking for invalid operators, preventing division by zero, and ensuring correct logic for Armstrong numbers and natural numbers.
