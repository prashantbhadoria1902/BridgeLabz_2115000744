Overall Summary;
1. 2D Arrays & Loops: Matrices are handled with 2D arrays and nested loops for element access.
2. Methods: Code is organized into methods for each matrix operation (add, subtract, multiply, transpose, inverse, determinant).
3. Random Numbers & Formatting: Random numbers generate test matrices, and printf formats output for readability.

# 29/01/2025
Overall Summary;
1. String and Number Operations – Includes functions for string manipulations (palindrome check, anagrams, substring occurrences) and numerical computations (factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, LCM).
2. Date and Time Handling – Uses ZonedDateTime and LocalDate for time zones, date arithmetic, formatting, and comparison.
3. Modular and Recursive Programming – Implements modular functions for tasks like prime checking, number guessing, conversions, and mathematical calculations, including recursion for factorial computation.

# 31/01/2025
Overall Summary;
1. Encapsulation & Classes: Each program defines a class (Employee, Circle, Book) with attributes and methods, demonstrating object-oriented programming.
2. Methods & Object Interaction: Each class has a constructor for initializing attributes and methods to process and display data (displayDetails, calculateArea, etc.).
3. Object Instantiation & Execution: The main method in each program creates objects and calls methods, showcasing Java's execution flow.

# 02/02/2025
Overall Summary:
1. Class and Object Usage: The code defines multiple classes (e.g., Book, Student, BankAccount, etc.), each with attributes and methods to model real-world entities.
2. Encapsulation and Access Modifiers: Private (private), protected (protected), and public (public) access modifiers are used to restrict direct access to class attributes and enforce controlled access through getter and setter methods.
3. Inheritance and Constructor Overloading: Subclasses (e.g., PostgraduateStudent, EBook, SavingsAccount, Manager) extend base classes to inherit properties, and constructor overloading is used to initialize objects with default and parameterized values.

# 04/02/2025
Overall Summary:
1. Static Features – Shared variables (e.g., bank name, library name, discount) and methods to manage global properties.
2. Final Variables – Ensures unique identifiers (e.g., account number, ISBN, product ID) remain unchanged.
3. Instanceof Validation – Confirms object type before processing details.
Problem Statement: Bank Account System(BankAccount.java), Library Management System(Book.java),Employee Management System (Employee.java), Shopping Cart System(Product.java), University Student Management(Student.java), Vehicle Registration System(Vehicle.java), Hospital Management System(Patient.java)
