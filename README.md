Overall Summary;
1. 2D Arrays & Loops: Matrices are handled with 2D arrays and nested loops for element access.
2. Methods: Code is organized into methods for each matrix operation (add, subtract, multiply, transpose, inverse, determinant).
3. Random Numbers & Formatting: Random numbers generate test matrices, and printf formats output for readability.

# 29/01/2025
Overall Summary;
1. String and Number Operations – Includes functions for string manipulations (palindrome check, anagrams, substring occurrences) and numerical computations (factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, LCM).
2. Date and Time Handling – Uses ZonedDateTime and LocalDate for time zones, date arithmetic, formatting, and comparison.
3. Modular and Recursive Programming – Implements modular functions for tasks like prime checking, number guessing, conversions, and mathematical calculations, including recursion for factorial computation.

# 31/01/2025
Overall Summary;
1. Encapsulation & Classes: Each program defines a class (Employee, Circle, Book) with attributes and methods, demonstrating object-oriented programming.
2. Methods & Object Interaction: Each class has a constructor for initializing attributes and methods to process and display data (displayDetails, calculateArea, etc.).
3. Object Instantiation & Execution: The main method in each program creates objects and calls methods, showcasing Java's execution flow.

# 02/02/2025
Overall Summary:
1. Class and Object Usage: The code defines multiple classes (e.g., Book, Student, BankAccount, etc.), each with attributes and methods to model real-world entities.
2. Encapsulation and Access Modifiers: Private (private), protected (protected), and public (public) access modifiers are used to restrict direct access to class attributes and enforce controlled access through getter and setter methods.
3. Inheritance and Constructor Overloading: Subclasses (e.g., PostgraduateStudent, EBook, SavingsAccount, Manager) extend base classes to inherit properties, and constructor overloading is used to initialize objects with default and parameterized values.

# 04/02/2025
Overall Summary:
1. Static Features – Shared variables (e.g., bank name, library name, discount) and methods to manage global properties.
2. Final Variables – Ensures unique identifiers (e.g., account number, ISBN, product ID) remain unchanged.
3. Instanceof Validation – Confirms object type before processing details.

# 10/02/2025
1. Interface: Defines a contract in OOP, specifying methods that a class must implement without providing their implementation. It enables abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
2. Encapsulation: Restricts direct access to an object's data by using access modifiers (private, protected, public), ensuring data security and integrity. It promotes modularity and maintainability. 
3. Relation: Interfaces provide abstraction, while encapsulation hides data. Together, they enhance code reusability, maintainability, and security in object-oriented programming.

Problem Statement: BankingSystem, ECommerce Platform, Employee Management, Hospital Management System, Library Management System, Online Delivery System, Ride Hailing System, Vehicle Rental System

1. Definition: A LinkedList is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node (Singly LinkedList) or both next and previous nodes (Doubly LinkedList). 
2. Advantages: Efficient insertions and deletions (O(1) at the head or tail), dynamic size allocation, and better memory utilization compared to arrays for frequent modifications. 
3. Disadvantages: Higher memory usage due to extra pointers, slower access time (O(n) for searching), and complex implementation compared to arrays.

Problem Statement: Inventory, Library, Movie LinkedList, Round Robin Scheduler, Student Linked List, Task Scheduler, Text Editor, Ticket Reservation System, User.

# 13/02/2025
1. HashMap: A key-value data structure offering O(1) average-time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups, but with unordered storage and potential hash collisions. 
2. Stack: A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure with O(1) push and pop operations, commonly used in recursion, backtracking, and expression evaluation, but has limited element access. 
3. Queue: A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure used in scheduling, resource management, and BFS, efficient for insertions and deletions but with limited random access.

Problem Statement: a. HashMap: CustomHashMap, Longest Consecutive Sequence, Pair with given Sum, Two Sum, Zero Sum Subarrays
                   b. Circular Tour, Queue using Stack, Sliding Window Max, Sort Stack Recursively, Stock Span
